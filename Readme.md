## Overview :+1: :smile: :+1:

I am currently studying towards a PhD in Bioengineering at the [ABI](http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz/en.html),my work investigates the mechanics of lung microtissue mechanics using FEM models constructed from ÂµCT imaging data taked from chemically fixed, excised rat lungs. Unfortunately I am not 100% sure what project I will be working on during this course.

## Synopsis

I am trying to solve for a stress field given an arbitrary geometry that is subject to known loads and boundary conditions, these models are being developed using [abaqus](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/), and need to e functional for nonlinear deforamtions and hyperelastic materials. :honey_pot: This is being done concurrently as part of the Digital skills for ABI researchers course. This repository covers the developement of a testing and results retrieval framework to speed up developement of the model.

## Code Example

* TO BE COMPLETED

## Motivation

The lungs exist in a state of 'prestress' in-vivo - that is they are in equilibrium with pressure loads and tissue elasticity. I aim to incorporate this into my models of simple deformation so that they are more representitive of the in-vivo state. As when initially imported, my meshes are assumed to be stress-free.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License
