## Overview :+1: :smile: :+1:

I am currently studying towards a PhD in Bioengineering at the [ABI](http://www.abi.auckland.ac.nz/en.html), my work looks at the mechanics of lung microtissue using FEM models constructed from ÂµCT imaging data taked from chemically fixed, excised rat lungs. 

## Synopsis

I am trying to solve for a stress field for an arbitrary geometry that is subject to known loads and boundary conditions, these models are being developed using [abaqus](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/), and need to be functional for nonlinear deformations and hyperelastic materials. :honey_pot: This is being done concurrently as part of the Digital skills for ABI researchers course. This repository covers the developement of a testing and results retrieval framework to speed up developement of the model.

## Code Example

* TO BE COMPLETED

## Motivation

The lungs exist in a state of 'prestress' in-vivo - that is they are in equilibrium with pressure loads and tissue elasticity. I aim to incorporate this into my models of simple deformation so that they are more representitive of the in-vivo state. As when initially imported, my meshes are assumed to be stress-free.
