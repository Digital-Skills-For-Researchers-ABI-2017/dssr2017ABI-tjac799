## Project Management

This document contains a selection of notes comparing **waterfall management** compared to **agile project developement**. I remember hearing about agile developement being used at Fisher & Paykel.

### Waterfall Project Management

developement of an end product by creating its components in a linear sequence of steps, each component is worked on individually 
and when finished the next component is started upon. Can be thought of as Plan :arrow_forward: Build :arrow_forward: Test :arrow_forward: Deliver

As an example: if working on image based model, the workflow could be divided into data gather (imaging), analysis, discussion. If the component are adress individually in a 
linear fashion, then any mistake in imaging will only be picked up in the analysis stage once all of the imaging has been completed. 

This is where agile developement comes into it's own.

### Agile Project Management

Continuous cycles of Plan :arrow_forward: Build :arrow_forward: Test where each cycle creates a somewhat complete workflow (end product), this is a highly iterative method of time-management. Where issues with previous builds are used to inform
the subsequent cycle. 

If you know **EXACTLY** what you need to produce, waterfall management is fine. However in research or commercial software developement, the end product is often not fully defined (or changes over time) - 
this is where agile developement is better as it is highly **adaptable** and **iterative**. Allows **rapid prototyping** and developement :smile:

#### SCRUM methodology
Outlines a cycle of planning, building, and testing that we can use to develope in an [agile](https://github.com/Toby-Jackson/dssr2017ABI-tjac799/new/master#agile-project-management) manner. ![alt text](https://github.com/Toby-Jackson/dssr2017ABI-tjac799/blob/master/Notes/scrum-process.png )
- Backlog (complete wishlist)
- Sprint Backlog (high priority items to be completed in a sprint)
- Sprint
- Review (how did the sprint go? how could subsequent sprints be improved? In what state is the output from the Sprint)

#### SCRUM Roles

1. Product Owner, determines what to build - for me that is my supervisors, expert in field
2. Developement Team, determines *how* to build it
3. SCRUM master, supports the *agile* process

#### Conflicts of Interest
Think about these beforet they become an issue, for example: 

Dev Team member is also the SCRUM master . . . 

#### User Stories

AS A ... \[Role]\
I WANT ...\[Goal]\
SO THAT ...\[Benefit]

e.g\
AS AN *early PhD Student*\
I WANT *to learn data management and version control*\
SO THAT *I can work more efficiently and reproducibly in the future*
