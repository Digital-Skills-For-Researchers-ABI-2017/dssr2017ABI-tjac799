## Data management

What kind of data will I be working with, and how can it be organised.

### Why?

Keep track of who generated it. Make it easy to share. Easy to use. Future proof it, will it be openable in the future... are there sofftware version compatibility issues.

## Data Management plans

1. Organise, clear, concise, **consistant** /don't name files in an adhoc way

Have a naming convention and stick with it. Be **consistent**. Every name, for folder and files should be unique. Document your conventions. 
Everyting should be searchable. Rule of Thumb is never have more than a three-level embedding when using a folder system. Avoid using the same name for sub-folders.

2. Data collection, is information lost in compression? 

3. How is your data backed up? What conventions will be followed. Where will it be backed up.
