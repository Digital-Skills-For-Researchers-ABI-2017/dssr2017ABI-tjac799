## Data management

What kind of data will I be working with, and how can it be organised.

### Why?

Keep track of who generated it. Make it easy to share. Easy to use. Future proof it, will it be openable in the future... are there sofftware version compatibility issues.

## Data Management plans

1. Organise, clear, concise, **consistant** /don't name files in an adhoc way

Have a naming convention and stick with it. Be **consistent**. Every name, for folder and files should be unique. Document your conventions. 
Everyting should be searchable. Rule of Thumb is never have more than a three-level embedding when using a folder system. Avoid using the same name for sub-folders.

2. Data collection, is information lost in compression? 

3. How is your data backed up? What conventions will be followed. Where will it be backed up. Make sure your data is backed up in different physical locations. Is your harddrive mirrored?

4. could your data have errors? How can these be detected.

## Naming Files and Folders

- project
- date of creation YYYYMMDD, this is used because it will sort chronologically
- initials of creator
- description of content
- collection method
- version number

Metadata doesn't survive exporting file types, be aware of this. Capture the metadata, and put it in a format that won't be so sensitive, for example .txt files

Metadata file can be used like a lab notebook in that you keep track of what is changing in the files. 

### File Formats

Use open formats, make sure your data will always be useable. 

DO [DATA CARPENTRY](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) - short course on data cleaning

Be cautious what cloud service you use to back up your data, what country are the servers in, is this an issue for your ethics?
