## Random Things that I thought were wise

Don't plan to full your day, there is high probability that low probability events will occur.

Overestimate how long you think things will take, things usually take longer

Seperate things that are seperate, understand where the contingencies are

Cards in a project should be actionable items, break jobs into fragments - essentially simplex items.

Keep work and personal seperate

control your own space

Where is my time best spent

Always assume you are working tired and not at your best, your file system should make it hard for stupid errors to occur.
